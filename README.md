This is a project to show recipes and allow and track modifications to said recipe. The idea is that recipes change over time - e.g. although the original recipe called for 1 tsp of cumin, we have found it's better with 2 tsp of cumin. 
And maybe we then back it off to 1.5 tsp cumin. 
Making multiple changes to multiple recipes gets messy in a spreadsheet or document.

The goal is to let you pick a recipe from a list, show said recipe, including original quanities and any modified quantities, and allow you to easily update the quantity.
Eventually it would be nice to be able to export a shopping list from a recipe, too. TBD.
